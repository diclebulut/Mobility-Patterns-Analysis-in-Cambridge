# Urban Mobility Analysis in Cambridge using Gowalla dataset

The dataset used in the analysis is available in this repository. 
Package requirements are as stated in the jupyter notebook.
This project is originally put together to fulfill Mining Social and Geographic Datasets module at UCL.

This code analyses the mobility patterns of an individual and the entierity of the check-ins to visualise mobility and visit trends. 

The dataset ‘Cambridge Gowalla’ contains 1870 check-in entries from October 2009 to October 2010 for 191 users. In this period, user 26598, our user of interest, has 13 unique location visits among a total of 53 check-ins. The most visited place is the William Gates Building, Department of Computer Science and Technology (14 times). This individual also visited King’s College often (11 times). The Guildhall, a building that often hosts conferences, and “Wok You”, a restaurant, are also frequented by this individual. Finally, they visited Emmanuel College and Barr Ellison Law Firm twice. It is important to note that the names of the places are an approximation generated by observing the street map since there is no dictionary to find what the location IDs correspond to.

All maps and visualisations can be reproduced with the available dataset and the code provided.
